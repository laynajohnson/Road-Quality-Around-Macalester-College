# Road Quality Around Macalester College
The purpose of this study is to assess road quality conditions around Macalester College during the transition from winter to spring. Using a vehicle-mounted accelerometer, I will map spatial variations in road conditions to identify areas with poor conditions such as potholes and rough surfaces. By analyzing these variations, I aim to provide insights into how road conditions impact vehicular safety and highlight the areas in need of maintenance. This study will contribute to a better understanding of localized road quality issues and inform decision-making for improvements. I aim to answer the following question: As the winter comes to an end, how do road quality conditions vary around Macalester College?
